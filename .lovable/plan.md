## Slides Overview

### Slide 1 — Title / Hook
"What Do I Really Need to Know?" with animated visual of chaotic data particles converging into 5 clean headline cards — clarity from chaos.

### Slide 2 — The Problem (Noise)
Animated scrolling headlines in the background (simulated news ticker) with the key pain points appearing over them. "Too much information. Not enough signal." as a bold centered closer.

### Slide 3 — Why This Is a Business Problem
Stats displayed as animated counters (100+ countries, 6M+ workers, 500+ articles/day, 5-10 read). Bold red-toned callout for the risk message.

### Slide 4 — The Core Question
Full-screen centered text: "Out of 500+ articles a day… Which 5 should leadership actually read?" with an animated funnel graphic (500+ narrowing to 5).

### Slide 5 — The Solution
"Meet the Gig Work News Agent" introduction with feature bullets and a **mock Slack message preview** — a realistic Slack-styled card showing structured news blocks with High/Medium/Low risk badges and source links.

### Slide 6 — How It Works
Horizontal flow diagram with animated steps: Web Scan → 500+ Articles → Filter → Risk Assessment → Slack Delivery. Each step animates in sequence.

### Slide 7 — The Tech Stack
Clean architecture diagram: News APIs → Python Agent (AWS) → Slack. Glassmorphism cards for each technology component.

### Slide 8 — Why Slack Matters
Slack logo prominence with the four key benefits. "If it's not in Slack, it doesn't exist." as a bold closer.

### Slide 9 — Impact
Before/after comparison layout with metric arrows (↓ monitoring time, ↑ response speed, ↑ strategic confidence) using animated indicators.

### Slide 10 — Who This Scales To
Expandable cards for future verticals (Payments, E-commerce, AI governance, Trust & Safety). "The agent pattern is reusable. The value compounds."

### Slide 11 — Why This Matters Now
Urgency-driven slide with accelerating timeline visual. "Can we afford not to?" as the closing question.

### Slide 12 — Closing / CTA
"From News to Insight. From Insight to Action." with three CTA option cards and a strong final line: "This is what applied AI for leadership looks like."
